## CO-PO Mapping

Flexible computational tool for the Outcome based Education

## Introduction


* Currently, outcome-based education (OBE) is getting more attention in engineering institutes for continuous improvement of the quality of the teaching-learning process. 

* Evaluation and analysis of the attainment of course outcomes (COs) and programme outcomes (POs) through mapping (correlation) helps to manage the quality loop. 

* From this practice, faculty can review the progress made by the student's performance and the stakeholder's inputs for better job performance and achieve the desired outcomes. 
But the mapping process for CO attainment is complex in nature, and it needs more time for execution. 

* To assist the faculty with their busy schedules, a fast, generalized, and automated tool has been developed for CO-PO mapping and attainment evaluation and analysis. 

* This is suitable for open and distance learning education due to the paperless assessment. 

* Through this exercise, faculty can supply the actual obtained students' marks to the tool/app and generate the results for the attainment analysis.

* It saves the faculty burden and allows quick decisions on the quality improvement process.

* The procedure is generalised with the number of exams, number of COs, multiple COs tagged to a single question, number of PSOs, number of questions and weightage in marks.
